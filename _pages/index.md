I'm Ian and I wear many hats of many colours -- though usually I'm found wearing my frontend developer trilby. In my spare time I wear a photography beanie. And the rest of the time I'm wearing a parental hard hat.

I work at the Government Digital Service as a frontend developer. Here I'm the tech lead for the team that's making GOV.UK more accessible.

I'm chipping away at putting sorting my photos into some coherant collections and trying to write about stuff more. Currently I'm not doing so well at this...

And together with my amazing Amy we're nurturing and raising two energetic, inquisitive, and caring children -- a now five year old and a just three month old.

My work and codey projects are on [GitHub](https://inj.ms/github), my [CV is on LinkedIn](https://inj.ms/linkedin), and some photos are on [Instagram](https://inj.ms/instagram). You should take a look.
